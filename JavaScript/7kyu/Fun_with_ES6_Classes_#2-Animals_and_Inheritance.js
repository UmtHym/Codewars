// Fun with ES6 Classes #2 - Animals and Inheritance

// Overview

// Preloaded for you in this Kata is a class Animal:

// class Animal {
//   constructor(name, age, legs, species, status) {
//     this.name = name;
//     this.age = age;
//     this.legs = legs;
//     this.species = species;
//     this.status = status;
//   }
//   introduce() {
//     return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
//   }
// }
// Task

// Define the following classes that inherit from Animal.

// I. Shark

// The constructor function for Shark should accept 3 arguments in total in the following order: name, age, status. All sharks should have a leg count of 0 (since they obviously do not have any legs) and should have a species of "shark".

// II. Cat

// The constructor function for Cat should accept the same 3 arguments as with Shark: name, age, status. Cats should always have a leg count of 4 and a species of "cat".

// Furthermore, the introduce/Introduce method for Cat should be identical to the original except there should be exactly 2 spaces and the words "Meow meow!" after the phrase. For example:

// var example = new Cat("Example", 10, "Happy");
// example.introduce() === "Hello, my name is Example and I am 10 years old.  Meow meow!"; // Notice the TWO spaces - very important
// III. Dog

// The Dog constructor should accept 4 arguments in the specified order: name, age, status, master.  master is the name of the dog's master which will be a string. Furthermore, dogs should have 4 legs and a species of "dog".

// Dogs have an identical introduce/Introduce method as any other animal, but they have their own method called greetMaster/GreetMaster which accepts no arguments and returns "Hello (insert_master_name_here)" (of course not the literal string but replace the (insert_master_name_here) with the name of the dog's master).

class Shark extends Animal {
  constructor(name, age, status) {
    super(name, age, 0, "shark", status);
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name, age, status) {
    super(name, age, 4, "cat", status);
  }
  introduce() {
    return `${super.introduce()}  Meow meow!`;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, age, status, master) {
    super(name, age, 4, "dog", status);
    this.master = master;
  }
  greetMaster() {
    return `Hello ${this.master}`;
  }
}

//We have to pass all the params into constructor and in the super. But if we want to hard code certain params, we can avoid it passing it into constructor as params and use it inside super if they exist in the parent class. If they dont you simply put it in the constructor and define it with this.example = example like we did in this.master = master
